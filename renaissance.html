        <h3 class="minhead">The House at the Minute</h3>
        <p class="mindesc">Originally built in a Gothic style, the House at the minute was redesigned in a Renaissance style after 1564.
            It stands in the Old Town Square near the Astronimical Clock.
            The house has faced a number redesigns and additions throughout the years as ownership passed from multiple individuals. 
            During the Renaissance a third floor was added to the original two-floor house. 
            In the 18th century an emblem with a Classicist sculpture of a white lion was added to the corner of the house, and can still be seen today.
            On the surface of the building, multiple scenes are depicted using the Sgraffitoes method. 
            These Sgraffitoes depict scenes from multiple religions and cultures such as: Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit, and the Roman Bacchus riding in a cart during a procession.
