        <h2 class="historyhead"> History of Prague</h2>
            <p class="hisdesc1">Prague was said to be founded by Princess Libuše and her husband, Přemysl, the founders of the Přemyslid dynasty around 800 to 1306 AD. 
                During this period, they established the Bohemian state, along with its early trade and relationships with surrounding regions. 
                    The kingdom's defensive and offesnsive were also put into place during this time.
                    From this dynasty came St. Wenceslas, the patron saint of the Czech Republic, and his brother Boleslav I.
                    It was under his rule that Prague came under the jurisdiction of a bishop.
                    During the Middle Ages, developments in economy arose. Bridges were built, defenses were fortified, and the house of Luxembourg came into power. 
                    Charles IV made Prague his capital in his reign as the Bohemian king and the Holy Roman Emperor.
                    By the 14th century, Prague rose up to be one of the major European cities. 
                    The Reformation was also an important event for the city of Prague. 
                    Uprisings and battles against the Roman Catholics allowed wealthy merchants to gain power in the city once more. 
                    This led to the entrance of Gothic architecture styles.
                    While the first attempt to overthrow Roman Catholic rule was successful, the Roman Catholic Hapsburg later gained control of Prague. 
                    This led to the Thirty Years' War; resulting in the defeat of the Protestants at the Battle of the White mountain. 
                    Prague's stat   us as the capital of the empire also came to an end. </p>

            <p class="hisdesc2">With the plague causing decline in many European cities, Prague had its economic and population regrowth during the 1770s. 
                    Merchants were once again the centrepieces of this revival, consisting mostly of German, Spanish, and Italian nobility. 
                    They influenced much of the architecture and culture of the city, resulting in the many famous attractions of the city today. 
                    The industrial revolution also provided many improvements for the city of Prague.
                    The population grew past 100,000 and expansion was inevitable. 
                    Nationalistic pride grew among the working class which led to the Czechs gaining more positions in the city council.
                    By the early 20th century, Prague became the capital of the Czechoslovak republic.
                    The population of the city rose to 850,000. 
                    Although challenges arose when large parts of the Bohemian region was surrendered to Germany, the Czechs responded with revolts until the arrival of the Red Army. 
                    After the events of World War II, Prague was able to rebuild and reconstruct its economy and culture. 
                    The arrival of communism became another barrier for social and governmental freedom. 
                    The Velvet Revolution of 1989 marked the end of communist rule in Czechoslovakia and the start of a coalition government.
                    After the Czechoslovak split, the Czech Republic stood with Prague as its capital. 
                    Currently, the city has become one of Europe's popular tourist destinations.
