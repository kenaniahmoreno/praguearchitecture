                <h3 class="vitushead">St. Vitus Cathedral</h3>
                <p class="vitustext">
                    Founded by Duke Wenceslas, the cathedral began as a rotunda in 925 AD. Later in 1344, Charles IV decided to build a Gothic Cathedral as the city of Prague became an archbishopric. 
                    The construction was delegated to the architect Mathias of Arras, who died before it was able to be completed. 
                    Peter Parler was then elected to be responsible for the construction. 
                    The vaults, the chapel of St. Wenceslas, the Golden gate and the lower part of the south tower's completion were credited to Peter Parler. 
                    After the 14th century, with the erection of a temporary wall, works on the cathedral were discontinued for almost half a century. 
                    In 1859, they were able to continue working on the cathedral because of a special commission. 
                    During this time, the western part of the cathedral was built and they also restored the Gothic designs of the structure. 
                    The St. Vitus Cathedral finally stood completed in 1929.
                    The cathedral stands in the Prague castle with its tallest towers reaching almost 100 meters. 
                    The western exterior contains a rosette window surrounded by reliefs of the saints the cathedral is dedicated to, along with some of its architects. 
                    The southern fa√ßade is divided into two by the tallest church tower. 
                    The left side contains parts of Neo-Gothic designs built during the 19th century. 
                    On the right of the tower, the designs and build originates from the 14th century.
                    Inside the Cathedral, columns and stained glass windows decorate the walls. 
                    Many artefacts from the previous centuries contained in the building.
                    Designs are attributed to architects and artists such as Alfons Mucha, Karl Svolinsky, and many others.

            <p class="tyntext">
                The Church of our Lady before Tyn is among the popular sites in Prague; its Gothic spires stand high in Old Town Square. 
                Its construction is also credited to Mathias of Arras and Peter Parler. Construction of the church began in 1350 and was completed in 1511.
                However, in 1679 a fire damaged much of the structure. 
                The church was then rebuilt; the interior designed in a Baroque style while the exterior still retains its Gothic design. 
                The church became a sanctuary for the Hussites and the protestants during the 1420s. a Golden chalice was placed between the two towers symbolizing a haven for the Hussites. 
                It was replaced with a Madonna and the Child's sculpture in 1626 when the Catholics regained control of the country.
                Three aisles decorate the interior of the church along with paintings by Karl Skreta and Jan Jiri Heinshe. 
                Sculptures and tapestries from the 15th century are also inside the church.
