        <p class="zizdesc">
            The Zizkov television tower is a transmitter tower located in zizkov area of prague. 
            It was built between 1985 and 1992, by designed by Vaclav Aulicky and Jiri Kozak.
            The construction of the tower began during the Communist era, with the intentions to jam West German radio and television transmissions. 
            However, after its construction and the fall of Communism, the tower was never used for its intended purpose. 
            The tower stands at 216 metres making it the tallest building in Prague. 
            In 2001, the Czech artist David Cerny added sculptures of crawling babies on the tower. 
            The Zizkov tower now consists of an observatory and a restaurant. It also contains a one room hotel and has 360 views of the city.
